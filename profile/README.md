# Nice Beaver 🦫

[Nice Beaver](https://nicebeaver.dev/) is a product-focused engineering team. We design, build and operate software systems end to end.

Our core principle is simple: **you build it and you run it**.

## What we do

We work on real production systems, not demos:

- backend services and APIs
- web applications
- automation and scraping
- cloud infrastructure and operations
- monitoring and reliability

We aim for simple architectures that are easy to understand, operate and evolve.

## Product: Cita Ping

[Cita Ping](https://citaping.es/) monitors availability of Spanish immigration appointments (cita previa extranjería) and notifies users as soon as slots appear.

- real-time monitoring of official government websites
- instant notifications via Telegram and email
- no booking on behalf of users, alerts only
- designed to handle frequent changes and high load

Cita Ping is fully built and operated by Nice Beaver.

## Engineering approach

- production first mindset
- ownership and responsibility
- boring and reliable over clever
- automation wherever possible

Most of our systems are built using Go and Python with a strong focus on operational clarity.
